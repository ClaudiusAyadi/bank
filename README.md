# Bank App - My First Solidity Contract

This is a simple bank contract with a base contract and a branch. 

The Central Bank oversees the GTBank, and has a log of every transaction. While the GTBank allows users to deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds. Then logs all the transactions to the Central Bank.

I could tell you that I did not know what I was doing when I started writing this, but hope to improve it as I progress in my learning.

Features I would love to see include:

1. Total Deposit
2. Daily Volume
3. More Branches
4. Frontend UI for CentralBank and GTBank

As I have stated, it is my first contract and I welcome critics, suggestions, or anything else. Thank you.
